Backend Security Project

A backend project for authentication and secure login built with JSON Web Tokens & bcrypt for authorization and authentication, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Sequelize and SQLite database.

Features:

    Account Creation and Deletion: Users can create an account and delete it if needed.
    
    User Specific Sign In and Log Out: Users can sign in to their specific account and 
    log out when finished.
    
    Post, Edit and Delete: Users and admin can create, edit, and delete posts, 
    allowing for dynamic and customizable content.
    
    Admin View: Admins have the ability to delete any post or user, providing 
    additional control over the content and users on the platform.
    
Concepts learned:

    Node.js
    Postman
    Passport
    Authentication & Authorization
    JSON Web Tokens
    bcrypt
    OAuth
    Front-End Integration
    Express:
        Models, Views, Controllers
    
    HTTP:
        Request Lifecycle, Verbs, Response, Codes, Routing
        
    SQL/SQLite:
        Queries, Forms (SQLectron)
        
    NoSQL/Sequelize:
        Migrations, Queries
        
    RESTful API:
        Full CRUD
        
After learning these concepts, I was challenged to build an express application with sequelize as the ORM, JWT and bcrypt for authentication & authorization. Users should be able to create an account, login securely, see their profile page, & have full CRUD operations. Admins should be able to do all of the aforementioned and be able to see a list of all users, & be able to delete users or their posts.
